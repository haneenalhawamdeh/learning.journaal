## Introducing How Computers Work
The Central Processing Unit
The computer does its primary work in a part of the machine we cannot see, a control center that converts data input to information output. This control center, called the central processing unit (CPU), is a highly complex, extensive set of electronic circuitry that executes stored program instructions. All computers, large and small, must have a central processing unit.
## How Computers Work: What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
The 2nd task of all computers, as you mentioned was "storage", is that referring to the cache of the processors or actual bulk storage mediums? I would assume it would mean temporary storage areas, such as the cache, because that is where the input has to go before it gets processed. Let me know if my assumption is wrong. But then where in the cycle does the bulk storage area fit in? Would it also be part of the output category, since data can be inputted, stored in the cache, processed, and then outputted, into a file that lies on a drive (bulk storage device)? For example, rendering a video, since the output is saved onto the drive, would it be considered as output?
## how Computers Work: Binary & Data
how computers represent numbers, text, images, and sound using tiny electric signals.
computers process the binary data via electrical pulses. To represent a 0, we have no pulse, and a 1, we a pulse. If we wanted to have more numbers added, we would use different magnitudes of pulses. However, the transistors are so good they can't quite detect magnitudes of pulses that well, but really can only detect the presence of one. To make it easier to detect the magnitudes, we could have the voltage be higher. But, if the voltage is higher, so is the energy consumption of the computer. For this reason, computers just stick to the simplest number system they can, binary.
## How Computers Work: Circuits and Logic
So adders add up the sum of the two numbers (0,1 taken) the first couple of numbers in the 25+50 example make sense 1+0 = 1, 0+0= 0 , but then 1+1 = 0.... and 0+0=1 and sometimes 1+0 = 0 ? Can someone explain why these are different? I can't derive the correct sum (75)
