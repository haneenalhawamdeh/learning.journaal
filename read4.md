## HTML5 layout elements. How old browsers understand new elements. Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS.

HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

Traditional HTML Layouts: For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

New Html 5 Layout El ements :

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already. Summary of Chapter 17 HTML5 Layout:

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure. The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements). Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements. To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
# Extra Markup
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). We will therefore be including one in each example for the rest of the book
